# Pool_dnds

Estimate **dN/dS** from Pool-Seq data using `.sync` files, GTF annotations, and reference FASTA sequences.

This tool enables calculation of non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) nucleotide diversity from pooled population sequencing data using codon-aware comparisons within annotated coding regions.
